    "Description": "It would be nice to handle the <Private> and <SpecificVersion> tags of the references in the project files. Switches could be added to force these settings. For example, to copy DLLs from a centralized Library folder where you want to use whatever latest version was put there, <Private> should be set to True (to copy the library to the application base folder) and <SpecificVersion>should be set to false.",
