    "Description": "Hi. I downloaded your app and tried running it on our huge solution with many folders, I got an error about a folder not existing (which obviously didn't make sense since it was finding the folders itself). The folder did exist but it also had a space in it. I think your app bombs with folders with spaces in it. Thanks.",
